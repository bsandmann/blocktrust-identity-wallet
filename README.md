# blocktrust-identity-wallet
A browser wallet for Atala PRISM

## Current releases
https://btpublicreleases.blob.core.windows.net/blocktrusttidentitywallet/blocktrust-identitywallet-20221127.16.zip

## How to run
Being just a POC at this state, you have to sideload the extension yourself and can’t just download it from the Chrome/Edge/Firefox Webstore.
But it's straightforward:
1.	Download the complete files of this GitHub repository
2.	Open Chrome → Extensions
3.	Enable the developer mode
4.	Click on “Load unpacked”
5.	Point it to the right directory and click Ok. If you get an error-message it usually means you are in the wrong directory 😉
6.	You might get an error regarding “manifest v2”, but that’s expected for now.
7.	The extension is now loaded. Pin the icon to have directly accessible.
8.	Have fun trying it out
